# High-Level Instructions

- Any new ideas should first be added to the **Ideas Backlog** section.
- Ideas are evaluated based on real pain points, automation value, and clarity.
- Accepted ideas are promoted into the main plan under a specific phase.
- Every step must favor minimalism, automation, and verifiability.

Documentation must include:
- Clear description of the use case/problem.
- Explanation of how the solution helps.
- (Optional) Example of usage or scenario if needed.

Always propose several solutions at different levels of complexity:
- Minimalistic version.
- Moderate version.
- Full feature-rich version.

**Testing First**: Design minimal verification tests before full implementation.

## Plan Phases

## Phase 1: Initialize Repository

- [x] Initialize Git repository locally.
- [x] Prepare initial `README.md` with project goals and setup instructions.
- [x] Create basic project structure (folders, placeholder files).

## Phase 2: Basic Hook Management Setup

- [x] Create `templates/` directory for hook templates.
- [x] Write minimal `pre-commit`, `pre-push`, and `commit-msg` hooks into `templates/`.
- [x] Write `install-git-hooks.sh` script:
  - [x] Detect `.git/` presence.
  - [x] Copy templates into `.git/hooks/`.
  - [x] Set executable permissions.
- [x] Make `install-git-hooks.sh` idempotent.
- [x] Implement graceful failure if not inside a Git repo.

## Phase 3: Automation Integration

- [x] Add a `prepare` script into `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "bash scripts/install-git-hooks.sh"
  }
  - [ ] Add automated detection of hook installation success:
  - [ ] Verify copied files exist.
  - [ ] Verify executable permissions.

## Phase 4: Repository Clean State Validation

- [ ] After running setup scripts:
  - [ ] Verify `.git/hooks/` contains correct executable hooks.
  - [ ] Verify no unintended files or broken folders.
  - [ ] Verify no staged changes (`git status` clean).
- [ ] Perform manual dry-run tests:
  - [ ] Try committing on `main` branch → must be blocked.
  - [ ] Try committing on feature branch → must succeed.

## Phase 5: Version Control Commit

- [ ] Create initial clean commit on `main` branch.
- [ ] Push `main` branch to GitHub.
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules (block direct pushes to `main`).
- [ ] Create and push first feature branch (e.g., `setup-hooks`, `automation-v1`).

## Phase 6: Advanced Automation (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Build a dry-run validation script.
- [ ] Build an auto-hook-repair script (optional future).
- [ ] Add `--quiet` mode for the installer script (for CI).
- [ ] Dynamic hook detection and installation.

---

## Ideas Backlog

- Build lightweight CLI for hook management.
- Explore dynamic templating for reusable scripts.
- Investigate multi-repository hook management.
- Automate README badge generation for hooks status.

---

# Quick Milestones

- [ ] Finalize initial hook install and verification system.
- [ ] Push minimal repository to GitHub.
- [ ] Plan next phase: enforcement and automation hardening.
- [ ] Validate project setup flow with test runner.
