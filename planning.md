# Project Master File: Git Automation and Workflow

## High-Level Instructions

- Any new ideas must first be added to the **Ideas** section (below).
- Ideas must be reviewed and evaluated before moving into the **Plan**.
- Evaluation criteria for moving ideas into Plan:
  - Does it solve a real pain point?
  - Does it improve productivity, speed, reliability, or reduce complexity?
  - Is the cost (in time/maintenance) justified by the benefit?
- No implementation happens before clear documentation and motivation are written.
- Documentation must include:
  - Clear description of the use case/problem.
  - Explanation of how the solution helps.
  - (Optional) Example of usage or scenario if needed.
- Always propose several solutions at different levels of complexity:
  - Minimalistic version
  - Moderate version
  - Full feature-rich version
- **Testing First**: design minimal verification tests before full implementation.

## Plan (Approved and Scheduled)

### Phase 1: Initialize Repository

- [x] Initialize Git repository locally.
- [x] Prepare initial `README.md` with project goals and setup instructions.
- [x] Set up standard `.gitignore`.
- [x] Create basic project structure (folders, placeholder files).

### Phase 2: Basic Hook Management Setup

- [x] Create `templates/` directory for all templates (generic, not only hooks).
- [ ] Write minimal `pre-commit` hook that blocks commits to `main` and `master`.
- [ ] Create initial hook template file under `templates/`.
- [ ] Write `install-git-hooks.sh` script:
  - [ ] Detect `.git/` presence.
  - [ ] Copy templates into `.git/hooks/`.
  - [ ] Set executable permissions.
  - [ ] Dynamic handling of templates.

### Phase 3: Automation Integration

- [ ] Add a `prepare` script into `package.json`.
- [ ] (Optional) Create a `Makefile` for hook installation.
- [ ] Add clear bypass instructions in `README.md` (`--no-verify`) with security warnings and proper use cases.

### Phase 4: Repository Clean State Validation

- [ ] Design and implement minimal verification tests first:
  - [ ] Verify `.git/hooks/` contains correct executable hooks.
  - [ ] Verify no unintended files (`git status` clean).
  - [ ] Verify manual commit test:
    - [ ] Block commit to `main`/`master`.
    - [ ] Allow commit to feature branch.

### Phase 5: Version Control Commit

- [ ] Create initial clean commit with working pre-commit hook.
- [ ] Push clean `dev` branch and create pull request to `main`.
- [ ] Finalize and merge minimal working setup.

### Phase 6: First Pull Request Focus

- [ ] Pre-commit hook must block commits on `main` and `master`.
- [ ] Manual validation and early automation.
- [ ] No unintended artifacts.
- [ ] Clear and minimal implementation only.

### Phase 7: Advanced Automation (Optional Future Enhancements)

- [ ] Build a `validation.sh` script to check hook installation correctness.
- [ ] Add `--quiet` mode for install script.
- [ ] Build self-healing installer (optional).
- [ ] Extend hooks (pre-push, commit-msg, post-merge).

## Ideas (Unapproved, Brainstorm)

### Future Enhancements

- Build advanced dry-run validation framework.
- Introduce templates for other purposes (CI templates, documentation templates, etc).
- Explore automatic reinstallation of hooks after `git pull`.
- Investigate dynamic configuration for hooks behavior.
- Lightweight local test runner to validate hook scripts.

## Quick Next Milestones

- [ ] Write minimal pre-commit hook template.
- [ ] Setup initial `install-git-hooks.sh` basic structure.
- [ ] Create and commit minimal manual verification checklist.
- [ ] Push clean feature branch to GitHub.
- [ ] Create first Pull Request.
