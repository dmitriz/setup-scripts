# Templates

## Purpose

This folder contains reusable project templates to accelerate setting up new repositories.

## Usage

- When creating a new project, copy `planning-template.md` as `planning.md`.
- Fill in the specific project objectives and tasks.
- Adjust the plan dynamically as the project progresses.

## Philosophy

- Templates are tools, not constraints.
- Minimalism preferred: only template what must be structured.

## Included

- **Planning Template**: Provides a consistent, minimal structure for defining project goals and tasks.
- **Other Files**: Flexible and manually written as the project evolves:
  - **rules.md**: Guidelines or best practices for the project.
  - **philosophy.md**: The overarching principles or vision for the project.
  - **ideas.md**: Brainstorming or feature ideas for future development.
