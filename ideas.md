# Project Ideas and Brainstorming

## Possible Future Enhancements

- Auto-generate README sections based on detected scripts/hooks.
- Build a dynamic loader for hook templates and tests.
- Introduce very lightweight CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) to validate hook setups automatically.
- Support multi-repo hook templating from a shared central directory.
- Create interactive CLI script to configure hooks easily without manual edits.

## Idea Review Rules

- Every idea must be traceable to a real documented pain point.
- No idea should be implemented before documenting the problem it solves.
- Prioritize minimal, maintainable additions over feature richness.
