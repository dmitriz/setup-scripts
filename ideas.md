# Project Ideas and Brainstorming

This file collects brainstorming ideas, feature proposals, and potential future enhancements.  
Each idea should be traceable to a real project need, reviewed for value, and documented clearly before implementation.

## Possible Future Enhancements

Below are ideas that could help improve project automation, flexibility, and maintainability:

- **Auto-generate README sections** based on detected scripts and templates.
- **Build a dynamic loader** for hook templates and associated tests.
- **Introduce lightweight CI** (e.g., GitHub Actions) to validate hook setups automatically on pull requests.
- **Support multi-repo hook templating** from a shared central directory.
- **Create an interactive CLI setup script** to configure hooks easily without manual editing.

## Rules for Reviewing Ideas

- Every idea must trace to a real, documented project pain point or optimization need.
- No idea should be implemented before careful documentation and review of its expected impact.
- Prioritize minimal, maintainable additions over unnecessary feature richness.
- Prefer scalable designs that will not add long-term complexity or technical debt.
