# Project Philosophy

## Minimalism First

Only structures and automation that solve real, documented problems are accepted.

## Automation Preferred

Every repetitive action must be a candidate for scripting, reducing manual burden over time.

## Testing-First Approach

Behavioral expectations should always be verified through lightweight automated tests.

## Scaling Clarity

Every design choice must scale to support future clean extensions, without creating unnecessary complexity.
